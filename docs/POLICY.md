# Privacy Policy for Route Exporter for EDDM®

**Last Updated:** December 29, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the Route Exporter for EDDM® browser extension ("we," "us," or "the extension") collects, uses, and discloses information, and what choices you have with respect to the information.

---

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data.

This extension is designed to run locally in your browser. It functions by reading the data explicitly displayed on the USPS EDDM® website (`eddm.usps.com`) to generate CSV files or copy text to your clipboard.

- **No Remote Server:** We do not operate a backend server. All processing happens on your device.
- **No Analytics:** We do not use third-party analytics (like Google Analytics) to track your behavior.

---

## 2. Permissions Used

The extension requires specific permissions to function. Here is why we use them:

- **storage:**  
  This permission is used solely to save your visual theme preference (Light, Dark, or System). This preference is stored locally in your browser via `chrome.storage.sync` and is never sent to us.

- **Host Permission (`eddm.usps.com`):**  
  The extension needs access to the USPS website to identify route data (tables, maps) so it can perform the export function. We do not read data from any other websites.

---

## 3. Data Retention

Since we do not collect data, we do not retain data. If you uninstall the extension, your local preference settings (theme) are removed by your browser.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

This extension interacts directly with the USPS EDDM® website. Please be aware that your use of the USPS website is subject to their own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

---

## 5. Open Source Transparency

This project is open source. You can inspect the source code at any time on our GitHub repository to verify that no data is being surreptitiously collected.

## 6. Contact

If you have questions about this policy or the extension, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.
