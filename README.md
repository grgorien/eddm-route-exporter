## Who this is for

This extension is built for people who actively run USPS EDDM® campaigns and need route data quickly and repeatedly.

It’s a good fit if you are:
- A local marketer managing EDDM campaigns for clients
- A print shop or mail house preparing route lists
- A local business owner running your own mailers
- Comparing routes across multiple ZIP codes

Most users need to collect route data from many ZIP codes to build intuition around household counts and estimated costs. This tool removes the manual steps so you can focus on the decision making.

You can:
- **Export to CSV:** Download route data for spreadsheets.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Paste data directly into emails or docs.
- **Flexible Selection:** Work with all routes on the map or just specific ones you've clicked.
